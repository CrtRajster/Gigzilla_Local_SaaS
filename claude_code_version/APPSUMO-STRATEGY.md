# AppSumo Strategy for Gigzilla

Use AppSumo as a **marketing channel**, not revenue channel.

- AppSumo lifetime deal: €360 (positioned as "4 years prepaid")
- Most traffic clicks through to your site for monthly (€9) subscription
- Win-win: Build user base + recurring revenue

## 💰 Pricing Strategy

### On AppSumo:
```
Lifetime Deal: €360 one-time

```
AppSumo = €360 (high price on purpose)
                ↓
"That's expensive..."
                ↓
Click to gigzilla.site
                ↓
